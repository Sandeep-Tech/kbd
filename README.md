# **âš  THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN PUT ON HOLD** due to some blockers.

---

Problem: Need a 75% keybaord (had mechanical in mind earlier but really preferring decent chicklets these days, like Apple's small one) and existing products are out of my budget.

Solution: Make a 75% keyboard myself. Hardware or Software, no problem.

### Software Keybaord:
- Planned to write it in react-native and run on my tablet.
- Found some blockers with showing the app as HID. Issue #2 goes into details. Also getting a Bluetooth library in react native is another issue.

### Hardware keyboard:
- Planned to get the PCB made from JLCPCB
- Microcontrollers are abundant
- Unable to source chicklet style key switches and mechnical key switches are so expensive that it fails the purpose of the project.
- On hold until I am able to source decent and moderately priced chicklet key switches (does not look like something going to happen).
